## Steps

### Solder QTPy

QTPy should go on the bottom (picture side) of the umbrellas bottom pcb (the small one) - so the USB jack is in line with the umbrellas pcb. Note - you only need to solder the "corner" pin positions plus the ground pin. 

Use the castellated pads or pin headers if you're more comfortable with those.

### Solder the 2x40 Pi Header

### Attach the 11mm and 5mm standoffs to the small pcb

### Solder a jumper across the LED jumper

Best to do this with a piece of wire from the bottom of the pcb. Then if you want to cut the jumper or replace it, it's easy to do from the bottom.

### Stack the pcbs

Place the 2 row pin header into the small pcb and then sit the top (large) pcb in place.  

Then screw in the four remaining 5mm standoffs to secure the top pcb.  

Solder the top pins for the pin header. Then solder the bottom half of pin header.  

### Solder the DIN MIDI jacks

### Attach Raspberry Pi

### Assemble case
